# 🏦 Banking Simulation — Realistic Console Banking System in C++

A **fully functional, console-based banking system simulation** built with **C++**, implementing real-world banking operations like account management, transactions, loans, and secure access.  

This isn’t just a menu-driven toy project — it’s a **modular backend simulation** with file-based persistence, OOP architecture, and real transaction logic, designed to model how core banking workflows operate.

## ⚡ Key Features

- **Account Management** — Create, view, update, and delete accounts with persistent storage.  
- **Secure Access** — All accounts protected by 4-digit PIN verification.  
- **Money Transactions** — Deposit, withdraw, and transfer money between accounts.  
- **Transaction History** — Logs of all deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.  
- **Loan Management** — Apply for loans, track balances, and make repayments.  
- **Receipts** — Auto-generate transaction receipts for records.

## 🧠 System Architecture

- **Object-Oriented Design** — Separate classes for accounts, money handling, and loans.  
- **File-Based Storage** — Uses C++ file I/O to persist data between sessions.  
- **STL for Data Integrity** — `set` ensures unique account numbers.  
- **Basic Windows API** — Simple loading animations for better user experience.  
- **Error Handling & Validation** — Protects against invalid input and unauthorized access.
